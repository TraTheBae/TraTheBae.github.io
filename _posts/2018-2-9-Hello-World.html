  One challege that I encountered was remembering how to code in html and remembering all the different commands that I had to use to program the game. I got over these troubles by going over to khan academy and reviewing the lessions.
  Im proud of the element of my game where it leads from lukes game to my game. It was pretty cool to have two games connected together.
  Well one good extension would be to finih the game and add some pictures and some more route sto take to eithe rdie or win the game.
